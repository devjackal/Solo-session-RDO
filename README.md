1: COPY This -> "Drive:\Steam\steamapps\common\Red Dead Redemption 2\x64\data" 
2: Replace "Drive" with the drive(C, D, etc.) where the game is installed. You can check it from steam.
3: Open the downloaded file. And to the last line, edit xxxxx by replacing it with a number, e.g. 12345. (must be the same number as the friend who wants to play together)
4: Save the file to the path in step 2.
